// You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, 
// but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, 
// there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or 
// the end of the sentence!

// This problem I struggles because I couldn't think What would create this
// after some research it's just a simple method, however I get the result
// but on codeWars it says error so tbd...
